# Open Office Hours

Open office hours are generally from...
- 8:00AM to 9:00AM on Tuesday and Thursday
- 6:00PM to 7:00PM on Tuesday and Thursday.

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md).

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects.
